         The UK’s current electoral system is not democratic and inherently flawed. Over the last century, there have been 21 occasions in which
         a party has obtained a majority of seats in parliament; of these occasions, only twice has that party also won the popular vote 
         (Veritasium, 2024, 1:50). Using this system, it is impossible for the UK to achieve a mathematically logical democracy, whereby each 
         person’s vote is equally valuable, or accurately represents the popular vote, and thus the will of the people. Condorcet’s theoretical 
         electoral system may provide a more democratic alternative by reducing the incentive to vote strategically (Szpiro, 2010). However, it 
         may be better to only implement certain principles, such as the ranking system from the system in order to improve democracy, as pure 
         democracy, where each person has the opportunity to decide who governs them may be impossible to achieve, or just simply impractical, 
         regardless of the system (Morreau, 2019).

        First past the post systems are one of the oldest electoral systems and these systems are still used in over 40 countries across the 
        world and yet it’s arguably impossible to achieve democracy using such an electoral system (Blais, 2008), (Veritasium, 2024, 1:13). 
        The UK can best be described as a constitutional monarchy (Tilly, 2007) and uses a first past the post voting system to elect members
        of parliament and the prime minister, whereby the candidate with the most votes wins (Blais, 2008). This seems logically democratic 
        mathematically; however, this results in frequent situations where the majority of a country’s population vote for any one of the 
        losing candidates, for example in the UK, single parties can achieve a majority despite receiving a minority of the overall vote 
        (Veritasium, 2024, 1:57). Democracy can be etymologically defined as to ‘rule by the people’ (Bredberg, 2020), however in these 
        scenarios, the majority of the people vote against the winning candidate. Changes to the system, such as a Condorcet’s proposed voting
        system, which allows constituents to rank each candidate and the winner needs to beat every other candidate in a head-to-head election, 
        may help to improve democracy and will be discussed further, alongside the issues of the current first past the post electoral system 
        (Szpiro, 2010).
