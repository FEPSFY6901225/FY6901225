         Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent
         machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component
         in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for 
         informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  
         including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty 
         sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective
         of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  
         (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  
         the  current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, 
         incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as 
         reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to 
         drop, as in Vlachos (2008).

    First past the post systems are one of the oldest electoral systems and these systems are still used in over 40 countries across the 
    world and yet it’s arguably impossible to achieve democracy using such an electoral system (Blais, 2008), (Veritasium, 2024, 1:13). 
    The UK can best be described as a constitutional monarchy (Tilly, 2007) and uses a first past the post voting system to elect members
    of parliament and the prime minister, whereby the candidate with the most votes wins (Blais, 2008). This seems logically democratic 
    mathematically; however, this results in frequent situations where the majority of a country’s population vote for any one of the 
    losing candidates, for example in the UK, single parties can achieve a majority despite receiving a minority of the overall vote 
    (Veritasium, 2024, 1:57). Democracy can be etymologically defined as to ‘rule by the people’ (Bredberg, 2020), however in these 
    scenarios, the majority of the people vote against the winning candidate. Changes to the system, such as a Condorcet’s proposed voting
    system, which allows constituents to rank each candidate and the winner needs to beat every other candidate in a head-to-head election, 
    may help to improve democracy and will be discussed further, alongside the issues of the current first past the post electoral system 
    (Szpiro, 2010).
