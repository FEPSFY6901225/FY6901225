        The UK’s current electoral system is not democratic and inherently flawed. Over the last century, there have been 21 occasions in which
        a party has obtained a majority of seats in parliament; of these occasions, only twice has that party also won the popular vote 
        (Veritasium, 2024, 1:50). Using this system, it is impossible for the UK to achieve a mathematically logical democracy, whereby each 
        person’s vote is equally valuable, or accurately represents the popular vote, and thus the will of the people. Condorcet’s theoretical 
        electoral system may provide a more democratic alternative by reducing the incentive to vote strategically (Szpiro, 2010). However, it 
        may be better to only implement certain principles, such as the ranking system from the system in order to improve democracy, as pure 
        democracy, where each person has the opportunity to decide who governs them may be impossible to achieve, or just simply impractical, 
        regardless of the system (Morreau, 2019).

        First past the post systems are one of the oldest electoral systems and these systems are still used in over 40 countries across the 
        world and yet it’s arguably impossible to achieve democracy using such an electoral system (Blais, 2008), (Veritasium, 2024, 1:13). 
        The UK can best be described as a constitutional monarchy (Tilly, 2007) and uses a first past the post voting system to elect members
        of parliament and the prime minister, whereby the candidate with the most votes wins (Blais, 2008). This seems logically democratic 
        mathematically; however, this results in frequent situations where the majority of a country’s population vote for any one of the 
        losing candidates, for example in the UK, single parties can achieve a majority despite receiving a minority of the overall vote 
        (Veritasium, 2024, 1:57). Democracy can be etymologically defined as to ‘rule by the people’ (Bredberg, 2020), however in these 
        scenarios, the majority of the people vote against the winning candidate. Changes to the system, such as a Condorcet’s proposed voting
        system, which allows constituents to rank each candidate and the winner needs to beat every other candidate in a head-to-head election, 
        may help to improve democracy and will be discussed further, alongside the issues of the current first past the post electoral system 
        (Szpiro, 2010).

        First past the post systems can lead to undemocratic outcomes. As demonstrated in Figure 1, there can be large percentage point gaps in 
        the share of the total popular vote and the share of the seats gained in UK general elections, reaching a 30% gap in 2024(Chu, 2024). 
        Logically, the share of seats in parliament should be correlational to the share of the popular vote.

      <pre id="Analysis_InText">
        Another issue that affects the democracy of British elections is tactical voting (Johnston R.& Pattie C., 2011). Tactical voting is a 
        phenomena where voters vote for the most likely opponent to beat a less favourable party (Walker 2024). It is an important element of 
        British electoral behaviour, in fact in the 2010 general election, approximately 17% of voters (Johnston R., Pattie C., 2011) surveyed 
        indicated that they were voting tactically,  in a separate survey, 12% of voters (Fisher, 2019) reported that they really favoured a 
        different party to the one they voted for, and from 1992 until the 2019 election, the percentage of tactical voters has remained at 
        approximately 10%. A reason for this is that the first past the post system encourages the electorate to vote strategically 
        (Veritasium, 2024, 3:34). This is because in a multiple party system, one party is not likely to win, and so it is not rational for 
        voters to vote for this candidate (Veritasium, 2024, 3:50), and so they are eliminated, and this continues until there is a choice 
        between two parties. This means that despite there being many major parties in the UK, it is the most rational decision for voters to 
        vote between two parties as they are the only parties that can win, demonstrating the illusion of democracy in the UK electoral system. 
      </pre>
      <pre id="Analysis_InText">
        Condorcet proposed his own electoral system (Veritasium, 2024, 9:32) where the winner has to beat every other candidate in a head to head 
        election. In this system (Szpiro, 2010) candidates rank each candidate according to their preferences, and the candidates are put against 
        each other and the one that receives the most votes is seen as a superior candidate and is ranked above them. After all pairings are 
        complete, each candidate is ranked on their wins and the candidate who has won the most is the winner of the election. In an ideal situation
        (Szpiro, 2010), there is an unambiguous winner who beats out all opposing candidates, however this rarely exists as usually no candidate 
        will win a showdown against every other candidate. Often voter behaviour may create a cycle according to Condorcet’s method, which cannot 
        always be solved by solving inconsistencies (Szpiro, 2010) as each judgement may receive equal majorities, so choosing which one to drop is 
        impossible. For example, there may be an election whereby A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C and C is preferred to A; in this 
        situation, there can be no winner. This is the impossibility cycle (Arrow 1984, as cited in Morreau 2019).
      </pre>
      <pre id="Analysis_InText">
        As a result of this, in it’s purest form (Szpiro, 2010), Condorcet’s system is not useful, however principles from this system can be used 
        to improve upon the first past the post system currently in use. The system is better at negating the effect of tactical voting on election 
        outcomes, representing a greater ability for the electorate to express their electoral preferences, and ensuring a fairer outcome. The 
        system also negates the effect of irrelevant candidates that can impact the outcome of a race.

 <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  <pre id="Conclusion_InText">
       This paper has examined the potential benefits of incorporating principles from Condorcet’s proposed electoral system on improving and 
       attaining democracy in the UK. While it is not suitable to incorporate the entire system, there are clear positives to Condorcet’s system 
       over the current electoral system, particularly in improving the electorate’s ability to vote according to their actual preferences rather 
       than to prevent a candidate from winning. In fact, according to Arrow’s (Arrow, 1984) conditions for democracy, altering Condorcet’s theory 
       slightly to follow his checklist could result in a much more democratic, if not perfect, electoral system. If the system can be adapted to 
       account for the impossibility cycles that can occur as a result of inconsistent yet not incorrect decision making, then the system could be 
       mathematically democratic as it is already transitive and independent of irrelevant alternatives.
